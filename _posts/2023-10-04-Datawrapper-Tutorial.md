This is straight forward, sign up or sign in by whatever method suits you. After signing in we can begin to use the magic of Datawrapper.

#### Choosing/Uploading Your Data

Once you are signed in, we choose to create a NEW graph, and it will take us to a screen that looks like this:

Here we can choose a variety of different ways to upload our data. For this tutorial we will use the Income vs. Life expectancy data set that they provide.

### Step Two: Check and Describe
#### Check the data
Now that we have the data loaded we should double check to make sure the data looks right and includes the information we want. There is a lot that we can do on this page like restricting variables to a range, checking variable distributions, and more. But if you know your data is good to go, this is more of a formality.

We can also choose to exclude parts of the data to make graphic creation more streamlined. In our case, we will exclude the population column.

### Step Three: Visualize

3. Choosing the Right Chart
Datawrapper offers a wide array of chart types. From classic bar charts to intricate Sankey diagrams, you're sure to find the perfect visualization for your data.

4. Customizing Your Chart
After selecting your chart type, it's time to dive into customization. Datawrapper allows you to tweak everything from colors and fonts to axis labels and gridlines. This level of control ensures your graphic aligns perfectly with your project's aesthetic.

5. Adding Context with Annotations
Annotations are the storyteller's best friend. Datawrapper enables you to add context to your visuals, highlighting key points or trends. This feature ensures your audience doesn't miss the critical insights your data reveals.

### Ensuring Accessibility and Clarity
6. Optimizing for Accessibility
Creating inclusive visuals is paramount. Datawrapper provides tools to ensure your graphics are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Alt text for images and clear color contrasts are just a couple of the features at your disposal.

7. Previewing and Testing
Before finalizing your graphic, take advantage of Datawrapper's preview mode. This allows you to see how your chart will appear to your audience and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step Four: Publish and Embed
8. Exporting Your Chart
Once your graphic is perfected, Datawrapper offers various export options. Whether you want to embed it in a presentation, share a link, or download it as an image, the platform makes it simple.

9. Sharing and Collaboration
Collaboration is seamless with Datawrapper. Share your graphics with colleagues or embed them directly into reports or presentations. The platform also supports live updates, ensuring your visuals remain current.
