#Intro and Motivation
This is where I will be presenting some of my findings about the big 12 school's sexual crimes. My previous blog post highlights my motivations further. But know that I am motivated by wanting to highlight the massive problem that is happening on campuses across the United States. So in order to do this, I had to answer this question; How does BYU stand against the other schools of the big 12? 

All my code and data can be found at [this](https://github.com/hermite2010/Stat_386_Final_Project/tree/main) github repository.

#Graphs

![OG_Rape_graph](/assets/images/School_Rape)
This first graph is the building block for highlighting the problem at American Universities. Very simply comparing the number of reported rape cases each year from 2020-2022 for each of the big 12 universities. But this led to the question; Each university has a different population size, so how does that change the report numbers?

![Rape10k](/assets/images/School_Rape_Per_10k)
This graph answers the previous question. Taking into account the yearly fall enrollment size for each of the three years, this graph highlights how many people got raped per 10,000 students on the campus. But another question arose, what about those that do not report rape incidents? How can we account for those?

![Rape_and_Potential](/assets/images/School_Rape_And_Potential)
This graph attempts to account for the unreported rape cases. According to [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system), only about 20% of rapes are reported for the college demographic. So this graph shows the potential range of cases that COULD be reported on each of the campus over the three years. 

While any number of sexual crimes is too much, the last graph is troubling to say the least. But it should be noted that Rape is not the only crime that is being committed on these campuses. For those campuses that have succesfully dettered rape more than others, there still remains the crime of Fondling that should be considered. 

![OG_Fondling](/assets/images/School_Fondling)
This graph help to visualize the different big 12 schools when it comes to reported Fondling cases on campuese during the three years. Similar to the rape cases, how do the numbers stack up when we take enrollment into account?

![Fondling10k](/assets/images/School_Fondling_Per_10k)
Similar to before, this graph takes into account the enrollment of the colleges and calculates the total number of folding cases for every 10,000 students enrolled on campus. But what about the unreported cases for fondling?

![Fondling_and_Potential](/assets/images/School_Fondling_And_Potential)
This graph takes the reported number as only 30% of the true total occurances (according to [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system)). We can then see the potential total fondling cases for each campus. 

![BoxPlot](/assets/images/Religious_Rape_Boxplot)
This graph compares the reported rape cases from non-religious universities in the big 12 to the three religious universities in the big 12 (BRighma Young University, Texas Christian University, and Baylor University). But what happens if we account for the campus populations?

![BoxPlot10k](/assets/images/Religious_Rape_Per_10k_Boxplot)
This plot is shocking to say the least. One would hope that religious universities would at least do better at preventing rape than non-religious universities. 

#Findings
Based on the data that was collected and compared, here are the things I found most intriguing. After accounting for the campus population each year, we can really begin to see how prevalent each crime is at each campus. Seeing TCU with the highest rape count per 10,000 students was shocking. It was also shocking to me to see how high up BYU was in the fondling cases when both before and after accounting for the studnet population. But the most shocking of all was noticing the potential total number of rapes and fondlings that COULD be happening on campus, but we have no way to confirm or dispute those potential numbers. 

#Conclusion
I hope that the data and the visuals will help others to recognize the problem standing before us. Whether or not schools are willing to do anything publicaly about this, I encourage all to be more aware, be safe, and be proactive in preventing further sexual crimes on college campuses. Places of education and limitless potential should not become grounds for the degenerate and depraved to take advantage of others.
